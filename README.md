# StudyCards Backend

The *StudyCards-backend* is the backend for the StudyCards application, built using Django Rest Framework. It has been designed for  ([StudyCards-frontend](https://study-cards-frontend-2200912dd99e.herokuapp.com/))<br>

# üìö StudyCards - Backend Overview

The **StudyCards Backend** is a Django REST Framework application that powers the StudyCards flashcard learning platform.  
It provides a secure and scalable API for managing user accounts, flashcards, and review history.  
The backend handles user authentication, data validation, and database interactions, ensuring smooth functionality for all front-end operations.

---

## üîß Core Responsibilities
- **User Authentication**: Handles secure user registration, login, logout, and session management using tokens.
- **Flashcard Management**: Supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user-created flashcards.
- **Review Tracking**: Records users' review sessions, including scores and learning streaks, to help track progress over time.
- **API Provision**: Offers RESTful endpoints that are consumed by the StudyCards front-end.
- **Authorization**: Ensures users can only access and manipulate their own data.
- **Filtering and Pagination**: Provides filter options (e.g., by topic or status) and paginates flashcard/review history lists for efficiency.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Main Components
- **Flashcard Model**: Stores flashcard questions, answers, topics, statuses, and timestamps.
- **ReviewHistory Model**: Tracks user review performance data such as score, total questions, correct answers, and streaks.
- **User Authentication**: Built with `dj-rest-auth`, `django-allauth`, and token-based authentication.
- **Custom Views**: ViewSets and API Views allow users to manage their flashcards and review history through intuitive endpoints.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter flashcards by topic or learning status, using `django-filters`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Django** (Python Web Framework)
- **Django REST Framework** (API Layer)
- **PostgreSQL** (Production Database)
- **dj-rest-auth** (Authentication system)
- **django-cors-headers** (CORS support for front-end communication)
- **Heroku** (Deployment platform)
- **Gunicorn** and **Whitenoise** (for production server and static file management)

## Project Description

### Main goals


## Structure

The database schema was created with [dbdiagramm](https://dbdiagram.io/home)

## Database<br>
A PostgreSQL provided by Code Institute has been used as relational database.<br>

- **Relationships:**  
  - **User to Flashcard:** One-to-Many  
  - **User to ReviewSession:** One-to-Many  
  - **Flashcard to User:** Many-to-One  
  - **ReviewSession to User:** Many-to-One  

<br>

### üìö Entity Relationship Overview

| **Entity**          | **Relation Type**         | **Description** |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------|:----------------|
| **User ‚Üí Flashcard** | One user can create multiple flashcards. |
| **User ‚Üí ReviewSession** | One user can have multiple review sessions recorded. |
| **Flashcard ‚Üí User** | Each flashcard belongs to one user. |
| **ReviewSession ‚Üí User** | Each review session is associated with one user. |

<br>

### üîé Additional Notes
- A user can **create, edit, and delete** their flashcards.
- A user can **review** flashcards and **record** performance via review sessions.
- Flashcards can be **filtered** by topic and learning status.
- ReviewSessions **track** the history of completed study sessions including score and streak.


A welcome message is displayed when you first enter the API site.

### Future Implementations

- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm:**  
  Implement intelligent flashcard scheduling based on the user's previous review performance using algorithms like SM-2 (used in Anki) to optimize memory retention.

- **User Statistics API:**  
  Provide additional API endpoints to deliver detailed analytics to users, such as learning streaks, mastery trends over time, flashcard creation rates, and review success percentages.

- **Decks and Flashcard Grouping:**  
  Allow users to create multiple decks (collections of flashcards) for better organization. Flashcards could be linked to decks through a ForeignKey, enabling deck-level filtering and review.
